    "Functions are advantageous to have in programs for:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Modularity: Functions allow you to break down programs into smaller, manegeable, and reusable pieces of code. each function can perform a specific task or solve a specific problem, making the overall program structure more organized and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. Code Reusability: Once you define a function, you call it multiple times from different parts of your program. this eliminates the need to repeat the same block of code, reducing code duplication and promoting reusability. Functions can be shared across multiple programs or used in different sections of the same program, saving development time and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "    c. Abstraction: Functions provide a way to hide the implementation details of a particular task or algorithm. By encapsulating a set of operations within a function, you can create a higher-level abstraction that allows you to focus on the functionality rather than the implementation details\n",
    "\n",
    "    d. Readability and Maintainability: Breaking down a program into functions can be given meaningful names that describe their purpose, making it easier for other developers to comprehend the code.    \n",
    "\n",
    "    e. Testing and Debugging: Functions enable easier testing and debugging because they allow you to isolate specific portions of your program. By writting test cases for individual functions, you can verify their correctness independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "    f. Code Organization and Collaboration:Functions facilities collaaboration among developers working on the same project. By dividing the work into smaller functions, different team members can work on separate functions concurrently."

Functions are used to breake down a program into smaller, manageable tasks, making the code more modular and organized. They can accept input parameters, perform calculations, and return results(optional). A function typically consists of a function signature (name and parameters).\n",

It is a statement that tells the program to execute a particular function at a specific point in the code. When a function is called, the program  jumps to the function's code block, executes the instructions inside it, and then returns to the point where the function call occurred."

The number of local scopes can vary greatly depending on the complexity and structure of the program, as well as the number of recursive function calls or nested function calls. In general, the number of local scopes can range from none(if there are no function or method calls) to several nested levels of local scopes, depending on the program's design and execusion flow."

Return values are useful because they allow functions to provide results that can be used in further computations or assignments. In an expression, you can use a function call and the return value of that function becomes part of the expression. For example, if you have a function called \"add_numbers\" that adds two numbers together."
